# DGCore
Core functions for DagovaxGames Arma 3 Exile missions

This package is required for multiple DG missions, and its purpose is to have global functions that are being
used in those mission scripts.

# Installation

1. Download DGCore-main.zip and extract it to your documents.

2. Place the @DGCore folder and all its content into your server (same directory as @ExileServer).

3. Add the line `@DGCore` to your `-servermods=` launch parameter

4. Start your server

5. Check in your server logs if you see the message `"DGCore succesfully initialized!"`.

6. If you do not see that message, all other DG script will also fail. So contact me at the Discord.
